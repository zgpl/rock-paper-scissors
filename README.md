# my first JS project
i wrote a game using javascript where you can play rock paper scissors with your computer. there is no html, you have to go to your console to play.

## please
don't misspell anything because i have not written any code that can deal with any wrong words or any bad spelling. my code assumes you will say the right thing.

## remember
to have fun and try out all possibilities!
